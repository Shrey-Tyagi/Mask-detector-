<h1 align="center">Face Mask Detection</h1>


## Working
* p5.js for making it on the web and use TensorFlow js (ml5.js) to classify.
* Here I have used my own images for model training and using transfer learning I was able to classify the things.


## Results
Low maintance light model for survillance purposes. This is a prototype just to show how gate keeping using survillance of masks can be done with ease. (This project repo was made for Def hack submission which won me 3rd place in Health Hacks)https://devpost.com/software/mask-detector

### Further Enhancements 
 To develope a project which is a door lock system, which opens only when the camera detects that user is wearing a mask.
